\title{Fixed Effects Meta-Analysis}
\usage{
fit_fe(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing yi (effect sizes) and vi (variances)}
}
\value{
A universe_result object with estimate, confidence interval, and p-value
}
\description{
Conducts fixed effects meta-analysis using the inverse variance method.
Assumes all studies estimate the same true effect size and that observed
differences are due to sampling error only.
}
\details{
Uses the metafor package with method = "FE". This method weights studies
by the inverse of their variance, giving more weight to precise studies.
Appropriate when heterogeneity is minimal or when testing for average effect
under the assumption of a common true effect.
