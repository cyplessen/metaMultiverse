\title{Three-Level Meta-Analysis}
\usage{
fit_three_level(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing yi, vi, es_id (effect size ID), and study}
}
\value{
A universe_result object with three-level estimate
}
\description{
Implements three-level meta-analysis to model dependency between effect sizes
from the same study using multilevel modeling.
}
\details{
Three-level models account for:
\enumerate{
  \item Level 1: Sampling variance within effect sizes
  \item Level 2: Variance between effect sizes within studies
  \item Level 3: Variance between studies
}

Uses sparse matrix methods for computational efficiency with large datasets.
