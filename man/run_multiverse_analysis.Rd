\title{Run Multiverse Analysis}
\usage{
run_multiverse_analysis(data, specifications, verbose = FALSE, progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame. Contains the dataset with all potential studies and factors
for the multiverse analysis.}

\item{specifications}{Data frame. Specifications generated using
\code{\link{create_multiverse_specifications}}. Includes columns for "Which" and "How" factors.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints progress messages and warnings summary.}

\item{progress}{Logical. If TRUE, displays a progress bar (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the aggregated results of the multiverse analysis, including:
  - Effect size estimate (\code{b}),
  - Confidence intervals (\code{ci.lb} and \code{ci.ub}),
  - P-value (\code{pval}),
  - Number of studies included in the subset (\code{k}),
  - The subset of study IDs included in the analysis (\code{set}),
  - The "full set" indicator (\code{full_set}).
}
\description{
Applies multiverse meta-analysis across all specifications and combines results into a unified data frame.
}
\details{
The function iterates through each row of the `specifications` data frame and applies
the corresponding filters and meta-analysis methods using \code{\link{general_multiverse}}.
Results are combined, deduplicated, and adjusted as needed. If "pet-peese (corrected)" is included
in \code{how_methods}, corrected PET-PEESE results are appended to the final output.

Steps:
1. Iterates through specifications to apply \code{\link{general_multiverse}}.
2. Combines individual results into a unified data frame.
3. Adds an indicator (\code{full_set}) to identify if all studies are included in the analysis.
4. Removes missing values.
5. Deduplicates results by keeping the first occurrence of duplicate rows.

 vi = runif(12, min = 0.01, max = 0.1),
