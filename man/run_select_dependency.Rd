\title{Handle Dependencies by Selecting One Effect Per Study}
\usage{
run_select_dependency(dat, ma_method, dependency)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Data frame containing effect sizes}

\item{ma_method}{Character string specifying the meta-analytic method}

\item{dependency}{Character string: "select_max" or "select_min"}
}
\value{
A \code{universe_result} object with results, or \code{universe_NA} if failed
}
\description{
Applies selection-based dependency handling followed by meta-analysis.
}
\details{
This approach eliminates dependencies by selecting only one effect size
per study, then applies standard meta-analysis methods to the reduced dataset.

\strong{Strategy comparison:}
\itemize{
  \item \bold{select_max}: May introduce optimistic bias but captures
        strongest evidence. Useful when effect heterogeneity within studies
        reflects meaningful variation you want to capture.
  \item \bold{select_min}: More conservative, may underestimate true effects
        but could be less susceptible to selection bias. Useful for
        robustness checks.
}

\strong{Advantages:} Simple, eliminates dependencies completely, compatible
with all meta-analytic methods.

\strong{Disadvantages:} Discards information, selection may introduce bias,
studies contributing multiple effects may not be comparable to those
contributing single effects.
