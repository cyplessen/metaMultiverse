\title{Create Which-Factor Mapping}
\usage{
setup_which_factors(data, which_factors = NULL, auto_detect = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing the dataset}

\item{which_factors}{Named character vector mapping display labels to column names,
e.g., c("Population Type" = "pop_type", "Study Design" = "design")}

\item{auto_detect}{Logical. If TRUE, automatically detects existing wf_* columns}
}
\value{
A list containing the prepared data and mapping information
}
\description{
Creates a mapping between user's original variable names and internal wf_* columns,
preserving original names for display purposes while standardizing for analysis.
}
\examples{
# User has their own column names
data <- data.frame(
  study = c("Study1", "Study2"),
  es_id = 1:2,
  yi = c(0.5, 0.3),
  vi = c(0.02, 0.03),
  population = c("Adults", "Children"),
  study_design = c("RCT", "Observational")
)

# Map to which factors with meaningful labels
wf_setup <- setup_which_factors(
  data,
  which_factors = c("Population Type" = "population",
                    "Study Design" = "study_design")
)

}
