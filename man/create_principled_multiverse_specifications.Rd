\usage{
create_principled_multiverse_specifications(
  data,
  wf_vars,
  ma_methods,
  dependencies,
  decision_map,
  factor_groups = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the dataset to base the specifications on.
Must be previously validated using \code{check_data_multiverse()}.}

\item{wf_vars}{A character vector specifying the "Which factors" (e.g., columns like \code{wf_1}, \code{wf_2}) to include in the specifications.}

\item{ma_methods}{A character vector specifying the meta-analytic methods to consider (e.g., \code{"reml"}, \code{"fe"}, \code{"3-level"}, \code{"rve"}, \code{"p-uniform"}, etc.).}

\item{dependencies}{A character vector specifying dependency handling strategies to include (e.g., \code{"modeled"}, \code{"aggregate"}).}

\item{decision_map}{A named character vector or list mapping each wf_var to a decision type:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"E"} (Equivalent): Different levels are theoretically equivalent -
        creates multiverse with individual levels + "total_wf_X" option
  \item \code{"U"} (Uncertain): Unclear which level is best -
        creates multiverse with individual levels + "total_wf_X" option
  \item \code{"N"} (Non-equivalent): Different levels represent distinct research questions -
        creates separate multiverse analyses (different multiverse_id values)
}}

\item{factor_groups}{Optional list of custom factor groupings. When provided, uses custom group names
instead of raw data levels for specification creation. Structure:
\code{list(wf_1 = list(group_name = c(level1, level2), ...), ...)}.
Enables sophisticated study selection criteria beyond simple factor levels.}
}
\description{
This function generates a grid of specifications for multiverse meta-analysis based on "Which" and "How" factors.
It ensures only valid combinations of meta-analytic methods and dependency handling strategies are included.
Supports both simple factor definitions and advanced custom factor groupings.
Data must be validated using \code{check_data_multiverse()} before using this function.
