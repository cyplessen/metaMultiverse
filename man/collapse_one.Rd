\title{Select One Effect Size Per Study}
\usage{
collapse_one(dat, rule = c("max", "min"), abs_cols = "yi")
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Data frame containing effect sizes}

\item{rule}{Character string: "max" (largest absolute effect) or "min" (smallest absolute effect)}

\item{abs_cols}{Character vector of column names to use for selection criteria (default: "yi")}
}
\value{
Data frame with one row per study (the selected effect size)
}
\description{
Reduces dependencies by selecting a single effect size from each study
based on specified criteria (largest or smallest absolute magnitude).
}
\details{
This function implements a selection strategy where only one effect size
per study is retained, eliminating dependencies entirely.

\strong{Selection rules:}
\itemize{
  \item \code{"max"}: Selects the effect size with the largest absolute value
  \item \code{"min"}: Selects the effect size with the smallest absolute value
}

\strong{When to use:}
\itemize{
  \item \code{"select_max"}: When you want to focus on the strongest effects,
        assuming larger effects are more reliable or theoretically important
  \item \code{"select_min"}: When you want conservative estimates, or when
        smaller effects might be less biased
}
