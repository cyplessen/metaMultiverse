\title{Weighted Average of Adequately Powered Studies (WAAP)}
\usage{
fit_waap(data, power_threshold = 2.8)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing yi (effect sizes) and vi (variances)}

\item{power_threshold}{Numeric. The divisor for power calculation (default: 2.8)}
}
\value{
A universe_result object with WAAP estimate
}
\description{
Implements WAAP, which restricts analysis to studies with adequate
statistical power, potentially reducing publication bias effects.
}
\details{
WAAP first estimates effect size using UWLS, then identifies "adequately powered"
studies as those with SE < |UWLS estimate|/2.8. The final estimate uses only
these powered studies. Requires at least 2 powered studies for estimation.

The power threshold of 2.8 corresponds to approximately 80% power to detect
the UWLS estimate at Î± = 0.05.
