\title{Define Which Factors with Advanced Grouping Options}
\usage{
define_factors(data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Your dataset}

\item{...}{Factor definitions using flexible syntax (see details and examples)}
}
\description{
Enhanced function for setting up which factors with sophisticated control over
how factor levels are grouped and analyzed in multiverse meta-analysis.
}
\details{
Each factor can be defined using several approaches:

**Simple factors:**
- `Population = "pop_column"` (multiverse with individual levels + all combined)
- `Population = "pop_column|U"` (same as above, U = uncertain which is best)
- `Population = "pop_column|N"` (separate analyses for each level)
- `Population = "pop_column|E"` (equivalent levels, includes all combined option)

**Custom groupings with decision types:**
- `Risk_of_Bias = list("risk_column", decision = "U", groups = list(...))`
- `Risk_of_Bias = list("risk_column", decision = "N", groups = list(...))`

  Where decision types mean:
  - **U** (Uncertain): "Which inclusion criteria should I use?" → creates multiverse
  - **N** (Non-equivalent): "These are different research questions" → separate analyses
  - **E** (Equivalent): "These measure the same thing" → creates multiverse (rare for custom groups)

**Ordered factors with decision types:**
- `Study_Quality = list("quality_column", type = "ordered", decision = "U", levels = c("high", "medium", "low"))`

**Binary combinations with decision types:**
- `Guidance = list("guidance_column", type = "binary", decision = "N")`
  Each level + all combined, with decision type controlling analysis structure

  # Ordered quality levels (cumulative)
  Study_Quality = list("methodological_quality",
    type = "ordered",
    levels = c("high", "medium", "low")
  ),

  # Separate analyses for different populations
  Population = "population_type|N",

  # Standard multiverse for guidance
  Guidance = "guidance_level"
