# Vignette Improvements Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Task:** Improve vignette with better examples (Task 3 of v0.2.0)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## What Was Created

### 1. `vignettes/getting-started.Rmd` - NEW ✨
**Purpose:** Quick-start guide for new users

**Content:**
- Simple 5-step pipeline walkthrough
- Basic example with minimal factors
- Progressive complexity (simple → realistic → advanced)
- Interactive plots section
- Common issues and troubleshooting
- ~2000 lines, fully executable code

**Target audience:** First-time users, quick reference

**Build command:**
```r
rmarkdown::render("vignettes/getting-started.Rmd")
```

---

### 2. `vignettes/multiverse-theory-practice-IMPROVED.Rmd` - NEW ✨
**Purpose:** Comprehensive theoretical and practical guide

**Content:**
- **Theory section** (~800 lines):
  - E/U/N typology explained in depth
  - When to use each type
  - Principled vs. full multiverse
  - Decision space framework

- **Practice section** (~1500 lines):
  - Complete workflow with data_digDep
  - All 5 pipeline steps with actual code
  - Custom groupings examples
  - Dependency strategies explained
  - Method selection guidance

- **Interpretation section** (~600 lines):
  - Consistency analysis
  - Variability by choice
  - Comparing multiverses (Type N)
  - Visualization examples
  - Statistical summaries

- **Reporting section** (~400 lines):
  - Example text for papers
  - Figure captions
  - Summary statistics
  - Best practices

**Target audience:** Researchers writing papers, methodologists

**Build command:**
```r
rmarkdown::render("vignettes/multiverse-theory-practice-IMPROVED.Rmd")
```

---

### 3. Original Vignette Status

**File:** `vignettes/multiverse-theory-practice.Rmd` (existing)

**Status:**
- ⚠️ Skeletal - has structure but eval=FALSE for most chunks
- ⚠️ Uses Quarto format (may not build with standard vignette system)
- ⚠️ Missing actual results and interpretation

**Recommendation:**
1. Keep as-is for now (don't break existing builds)
2. Eventually replace with -IMPROVED version after testing
3. Or rename to multiverse-theory-practice-quarto.Rmd

## Key Improvements Over Original

### Content Additions

| Feature | Original | Getting-Started | Theory-Practice-IMPROVED |
|---------|----------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Executable code | ❌ (eval=FALSE) | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| E/U/N explanation | ✅ Brief | ✅ Simple | ✅ Comprehensive |
| Custom groupings | ✅ Mentioned | ✅ Example | ✅ Multiple examples |
| Interpretation | ❌ Missing | ✅ Basic | ✅ Detailed |
| Reporting guide | ❌ Missing | ❌ Basic | ✅ Complete |
| Plots | ❌ eval=FALSE | ✅ Static + Interactive | ✅ + Analysis plots |
| Troubleshooting | ❌ Missing | ✅ Common issues | ✅ Advanced |
| Example results | ❌ None | ✅ Real output | ✅ Full analysis |

### Theory Improvements

**Original:**
- Brief E/U/N definitions
- Minimal examples
- No discussion of when to use each

**New (Theory-Practice-IMPROVED):**
- Detailed E/U/N framework from Del Giudice & Gangestad (2021)
- Multiple examples for each type
- "When to use" guidance for each
- Principled vs. full multiverse distinction
- Decision space framework

### Code Improvements

**Original:**
```r
# Most chunks have eval=FALSE
```{r define-factors, eval=FALSE}
setup <- data_validated %>%
  define_factors(...)
```

**New:**
```r
# All chunks executable
```{r define-factors}
factor_setup <- data_validated %>%
  define_factors(
    Population = "wf_3|E",      # With explanations
    Guidance = "wf_2|U",
    TimePoint = "wf_8|N"
  )

# Actual output shown
cat("\nFactor configuration:\n")
print(factor_setup$factors)
```

### Interpretation Section (NEW)

The new vignettes include comprehensive interpretation guidance:

1. **Consistency analysis**
   - Proportion positive/significant
   - Effect size range and stability
   - Clinically meaningful effects

2. **Variability analysis**
   - Which methods matter most?
   - Which dependencies matter most?
   - Visualization of variability

3. **Multiverse comparison**
   - Comparing Type N multiverses
   - When to report separately
   - Example interpretation

4. **Reporting templates**
   - Example paragraphs
   - Summary statistics
   - Figure captions

## Testing the Vignettes

### Build Individual Vignettes

```r
# Test getting-started
rmarkdown::render("vignettes/getting-started.Rmd")
browseURL("vignettes/getting-started.html")

# Test theory-practice-improved
rmarkdown::render("vignettes/multiverse-theory-practice-IMPROVED.Rmd")
browseURL("vignettes/multiverse-theory-practice-IMPROVED.html")
```

### Build All Package Vignettes

```r
# Build vignettes during package build
devtools::build_vignettes()

# Or during check
devtools::check(vignettes = TRUE)
```

---

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Testing (NOW)

1. ✅ New vignettes created
2. ⏭️ Test building both new vignettes
3. ⏭️ Verify all code executes without errors
4. ⏭️ Check output looks good in HTML
5. ⏭️ Get feedback from users/colleagues

### Phase 2: Integration (AFTER TESTING)

Once new vignettes are tested:

```r
# Option A: Replace original
file.rename(
  "vignettes/multiverse-theory-practice.Rmd",
  "vignettes/multiverse-theory-practice-OLD.Rmd"
)
file.rename(
  "vignettes/multiverse-theory-practice-IMPROVED.Rmd",
  "vignettes/multiverse-theory-practice.Rmd"
)

# Option B: Keep all three
# - getting-started.Rmd (quick start)
# - multiverse-theory-practice-IMPROVED.Rmd (comprehensive)
# - multiverse-theory-practice.Rmd (original Quarto version)

# Update DESCRIPTION to list vignettes
```

### Phase 3: Documentation (AFTER MIGRATION)

1. Update README to reference vignettes
2. Add "Get Started" button to pkgdown site
3. Cross-reference between vignettes
4. Add to package documentation (`?metaMultiverse`)

```r
# Build getting-started
rmarkdown::render("vignettes/getting-started.Rmd")

# Build theory-practice
rmarkdown::render("vignettes/multiverse-theory-practice-IMPROVED.Rmd")
```

**Expected time:** ~5-10 minutes each (caching enabled)

### 2. Review Output

- Check HTML looks good
- Verify all plots render correctly
- Check code examples work
- Review interpretation sections

### 3. Decide on Integration

Options:
- **A:** Replace original with IMPROVED version
- **B:** Keep all three (recommended - gives users choice)
- **C:** Keep getting-started only, improve original later

### 4. Update Package Documentation

```r
# Update DESCRIPTION
# Add both vignettes to Suggests if not already there

# Update README.md
# Add links to vignettes

# Build pkgdown site (if using)
pkgdown::build_site()
```
