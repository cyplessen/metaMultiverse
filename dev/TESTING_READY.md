# ✅ Testing Files Ready!

**Status:** All test files fixed and ready to run

## What Was Fixed

### Bug Identified
You caught a bug where I incorrectly included `k_smallest_ma` as a parameter to `create_multiverse_specifications()`. That parameter doesn't exist there - it's actually used internally by `general_multiverse()`.

### Files Fixed
1. ✅ `dev/test_pipeline.Rmd` - Removed 5 incorrect instances
2. ✅ `dev/quick_test.R` - Removed 1 incorrect instance
3. ✅ `HOW_TO_TEST.md` - Added FAQ explaining where k_smallest_ma actually goes
4. ✅ `dev/BUGFIX.md` - Documented the issue and fix

## Now You Can Test!

### Fastest Test (30 seconds):
```r
setwd("/Users/cyp/Documents/Work/1_Projects/multiverse-package/metaMultiverse")
source("dev/quick_test.R")
```

**Expected output:**
```
=== QUICK TEST SUITE ===

✓ Package loaded successfully
✓ Available MA methods: 11
✓ Example data loaded: 289 rows

--- Running basic pipeline ---
Data validation passed. Dataset is ready for multiverse analysis.
✓ Pipeline completed
  Attempted: 4
  Successful: 4
  Success rate: 100 %

✓ Effect sizes:
  Range: [0.487, 0.545]
  Mean: 0.516

--- Testing plots ---
✓ Spec curve plot created
✓ VoE plot created

--- Testing deprecated functions ---
Calling setup_which_factors() (should warn):
✓ Deprecation warning issued

=== SUMMARY ===
✅ All quick tests passed!
Package is ready to use.
```

### Comprehensive Test (~5 min):
```r
# In RStudio: Open dev/test_pipeline.Rmd and click "Knit"

# Or in R console:
rmarkdown::render("dev/test_pipeline.Rmd")
browseURL("dev/test_pipeline.html")
```

**Expected result:** Beautiful HTML report with all 8 test suites passing ✅

## What k_smallest_ma Actually Does

`k_smallest_ma` controls the minimum number of unique studies required for a valid meta-analysis.

**Default:** 5 studies

**How to change it:**
```r
# Set globally before running analysis
options(metaMultiverse.k_smallest_ma = 10)

# Then run normally
results <- data_digDep %>%
  check_data_multiverse() %>%
  define_factors(Population = "wf_3|E") %>%
  create_multiverse_specifications(
    ma_methods = c("fe", "reml"),
    dependencies = "aggregate"
  ) %>%
  run_multiverse_analysis()
```

**What it does:**
- Any specification with < k_smallest_ma studies will be skipped
- Prevents unreliable meta-analyses with too few studies
- You'll see messages like: "Spec 5: skipped (3 studies < 5 required)"
